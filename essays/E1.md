I am making this essay as a review so far from the labs I worked on. Even I am redoing the course and initially had the previous experience on WODs. I do not want to re-submit what I previously made. That being said, I did not start on WODs yet but the labs that I worked on showed that I have a lot of programming skills that I need to learn. 

Day by day, I am gaining more understand with how programming works, I am still struggling but as slow I am on learning, the knowledge is somehow getting to me that I can actually remember some programming language and able to interpret them in my own way. 

Time is one of my biggest enemy this semester and last semester also because of the changes happenning in the community. This class demands a lot of work time and I am doing by best to keep up with the work load. As they say no pain no gain. I just need to persevere and I will get it.
